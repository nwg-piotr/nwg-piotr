Hi, I’m Piotr - a middle-aged clerk, and after-hours FOSS developer. I’m interested in Linux, Wayland & GTK.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell-resources/master/images/smee.jpg" width="300" />

- I use [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org).
- I'm a member of the [ArchLabs Linux](https://archlabslinux.com) team.
- I'm working on the GTK shell for sway, called [nwg-shell](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell).
- I prefer python to shell scripting and golang to C.

How to reach me:

- Submit an issue on GitHub on the appropriate project page (preferred), or
- drop me a line at nwg.piotr@gmail.com.
