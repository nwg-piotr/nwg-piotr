Hi, I’m Piotr - a middle-aged clerk and after-hours FOSS developer. I’m interested in Linux, Wayland & GTK.

- I use [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org);
- I have been working on the GTK shell for sway and Hyprland called [nwg-shell](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell);
- I prefer python to shell scripting and golang to C.

How to reach me:

- Join the nwg-shell [Discussions](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell/discussions), or
- submit an issue on GitHub on the appropriate project page, or
- find me in the nwg-shell [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/@nwg-piotr:matrix.org), or
- drop me a line by email.

Do not invite me to a live chat, unless you have diction like John Hurt. I'm quite useless at listening to English.
